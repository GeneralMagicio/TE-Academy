      - question: Can I use The courses in open-source projects?
        answer: >-
          Generally, it is accepted to use  in open-source projects, as long as
          it is not a library, a theme, a template, a page-builder that would be
          considered as an alternative to itself.

          With that being said, feel free to use this for your open-source projects.
