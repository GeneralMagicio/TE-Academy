mainTitle: Study at TE Academy
studyTitle: So what is "token engineering?"
subtitle: Welcome to the Token Engineering community
bodyContent: Token engineering is a crossdisciplinary field that draws from established practices in systems, electrical, robotics & controls engineering, and more. It also draws from fields as diverse as Behavioural & Ecological Economics, Operations Research, AI & Optimization, as explored by Shermin Voshmgir & Michael Zargham in this paper on the Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems. It is a methodology that goes all the way from ideation to design, modeling, simulation, testing, deployment, and maintentance.

studySteps:
  - title: Define system goals & properties
    body: Token engineering design starts with understanding the desired goals of a
      given system, and then working backwards to determine the properties and
      structure required to achieve those goals. This is carried out in a
      baseline assessment, including system mapping & canvassing as described by
      Stephen Young in this article on the token engineering process. The good
      folks at the Platform Design Toolkit have a suite of tools that are useful
      for this stage of the design process.
  - title: Model System & Identify necessary Mechanisms
    body: Understanding the states, mechanisms and behaviours of your system and the
      agents interacting with it, the next step is to map your system flows into
      a differential specification diagram, which will inform your cadCAD wiring
      in the next step of the process. The differential specification diagram
      takes into account system policies, agent behaviours, and exogenous
      processes (i.e. random external events), and the complex interaction
      patterns existing between them.
